The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for DNS zone authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS can store records for other types of data for either automatic machine lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, DNS has also seen use in combating unsolicited email (spam) by using a real-time blackhole list stored in the DNS. Whether for Internet naming or for general purpose uses, the DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured zone file.
